#CPOLD the dumbest versioning system ever

Did you never issued a command like this one ?
```
cp myfile myfile.old
```

Never make such complicated thing again and use cpold instead
```
cpold myfile
```

don't worry if there's already a *myfile.old* file it will be **cpold** itself to *myfile.old.old* and so on

and for sure this is public domain :)
